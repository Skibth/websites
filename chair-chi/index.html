                <p><a href="https://www.physio-chi.com" class="redirect"> Physio Chi</a> <br> Physio-Chi is a modified movement of traditional Tai Chi. It is easier to learn & suitable for those who are unable to stand for long periods as required by traditional forms of Tai Chi. It doesn't invlove pivoting or twisting on the feet or require prolonged knee flexion (bent knees) & thus is particularly suitable for those with arthritis. People who cannot stand at all can still enjoy & perform a seated version of Physio-Chi. Participants are not required to perfect movements & thus progress quicker</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.aiab.net.au/ai-chi" class="redirect">Ai Chi</a> <br> Ai Chi is a water movement & relaxation program that combines elements of Tai-Chi and Qi Gong concepts, with Watsu techniques. Ai Chi is a total body relaxation & strengthening progression used for aquatic therapy. The program invloves a series of movements performed in a slow, focused manner & accompanied by a deep breathing. It is usually practiced standing in should-depth water in group classes. Ai Chi requires no equipment & allows the hair and face to stay dry.</p>
                <p>Watsu is and extremely gentle form of therapeutic massage conducted in warm water, combining elements of Zen Shiatsu massage techniques, including muscle stretching joint mobilisation & movements.</p>
