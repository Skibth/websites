            <p><a href="https://www.physio-chi.com" class="redirect underline">Physio-Chi</a> is a modified movement of traditional Tai Chi. It is easier to learn & suitable for those who are unable to
            stand for long periods as required by traditional forms of Tai Chi. It doesn't involve pivoting or twisting on the feet
            or require prolonged knee flexion (bent knees) & thus is particularly suitable for those with arthritis. People who
            cannot stand at all can still enjoy & perform a seated version of Physio-Chi. Participants are not required to perfect
            movements & thus progress quicker.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.aiab.net.au/ai-chi" class="redirect underline">Ai Chi</a> is a water movement & relaxation program that combines elements of Tai-Chi and Qi Gong concepts, with Watsu
            techniques. Ai Chi is a total body relaxation & strengthening progression used for aquatic therapy. The program involves
            a series of movements performed in a slow, focused manner & accompanied by deep breathing. It is usually practiced
            standing in shoulder-depth water in group classes. Ai Chi requires no equipment & allows the hair & face to stay dry.</p>
            <p>Watsu is an extremely gentle form of therapeutic massage conducted in warm water, combining elements of Zen Shiatsu
            massage techniques, including muscle stretching joint mobilisation & movements. </p>
